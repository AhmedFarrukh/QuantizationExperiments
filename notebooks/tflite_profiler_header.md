# TFlite Runtime Profililing
In this notebook, we use the TFlite benchmark to comapre the performance of Quantized CNN models to their original versions. The models considered are: MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, VGG16, VGG19.

The models were loaded and quantized in TFlite. In addition to comparing the performance of models, an operator-level analysis is also conducted for ResNet50 and VGG16.
